    <p id="p1">German Shepherds come in a variety of coat colors and lengths. While varying 
        greatly, coat color and length have no bearing on the dog’s personality or 
        trainability. The AKC recognizes many of these colors while adhering to the 
        breed founders statement, “No good dog can be a bad color.”  What constitutes 
        a bad color in GSD’s? To find the answer to that question, let’s look at what 
        this breed was designed for.</p>
    <p id="p2">The American Kennel Club (AKC) lists the German Shepherd in the Herding group. 
        While “Shepherd” is certainly in the breeds name, they can also be classified as 
        a working dog. Max von Stephanitz, the breed’s <img src=Bicolor.png alt="Bicolor" style="float: left;" height="200px"> creator and founder of the parent 
        club for GSD’s bred the first German Shepherd, Horand von Grafrath, to be a herding 
        dog. Horan was a brindle, or sable, dog. Von Stephanitz wanted a dog that would be 
        easy to see among the herd of sheep, but hard to see at night while guarding. It is 
        for this reason White German Shepherds cannot be shown in AKC confirmation rings. 
        (There is now a movement to have these white dogs recognized as a separate breed, 
        the American White Shepherd. For use in this article, though, they will be considered 
        as regular GSDs.)</p>
    <p id="p3">When you think of German Shepherds I am sure you picture those beautiful Black and Tan 
        Police dogs or Rin Tin Tin, one of three dogs and two GSD’s with his own star on the 
        Hollywood Walk of Fame. <img src="BlackTan.png"  alt="BlackTan" style="float: right;" height="200px">, these Black and Tan dogs are not the original GSDs. 
        As stated above, the original German Shepherd Dog was a sable male, Horand von Grafrath. 
        Capt. von Stephanitz admired this dog for his loyalty and obedience. All German Shepherds 
        can be traced back to this dog. Because of this, Sable is the most dominant of the coat colors.</p>

    <br><h2>Genetics</h2>

    <p id="p5">Now we will get to the genetics of coat colors. A puppy inherits half of its genes from each parent. 
       What color presents, or is shown, on the puppy is determined by the colors dominance. For example, if 
       your mother has blue eyes and your father’s eyes are brown, chances are your eyes will be brown as well 
       as brown eye color is dominant to blue. When a puppy inherits two different genes from their parents, 
       it is considered heterozygous. This means that a puppy can inherit one dominant Sable gene (SS) and one 
       recessive Black gene (bb). The puppy will present as Sable, but will be heterozygous and carry the gene 
       for black. If this puppy is then bred to a dog that is homozygous, or who has received only the black 
       recessive gene from both its parents, this puppy could still father puppies who present with that recessive 
       color as well as puppies that present with the more dominant sable.</p>

<p>The Punnett Square above shows a Homo Sable bred to a Homo Black. As shown by 
   the capital letters, the four puppies in this litter will all present as Sable. 
   Below is an example of when one of these puppies is bred to a homo black as well.</p>

        <td>AW+a</td><td>AW+a</td>

   </table>


<p id="p6">Based on the tables above, you will have a litter of sable puppies that, if bred to a solid 
    black, will produce both sable and black. Table 3 shows the colors of German Shepherd Dogs in order of dominance.</p>

    <table><caption class="sq">Table 3</caption>
        <tr>
            <td>Sable (aw)</td><td>Always dominant, never recessive. If a puppy inherits this gene, it will be a sable puppy.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Black/Tan or Saddle/Blanketback (as)</td><td>Recessive to sable, dominant to all others</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bi Color (at)</td><td>Recessive to sable and black/tan

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Solid Black (a)</td><td>Recessive</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>White (w)</td><td>Recessive (masking gene)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p id="p7">German Shepherds that carry multiple genes can have a very mixed litter. This is where 
        knowing your dog’s pedigree comes in handy. It also helps to have a basic knowledge of 
        the GSD genetics. For example, a solid black GSD will only produce solid black if bred 
        with another solid black, whereas if bred to a bi color that is heterozygous and carries
        the black gene (at+a), you may have a mix of solids and bi colors. </p>

    <p id="p8">Where does white come into play? White German Shepherds are colored dogs with the White 
        masking gene, not albino. This gene is recessive to all colors in GSDs and will only 
        show up if the pup inherits it from both parents. This gene hides all color and pattern, 
        making the dog white. If bred to any colored dog, unless the colored dog carries the 
        masking gene, all of your puppies will be colored.</p>
     
<table><caption class="sq">Table 4</caption>
    <tr>
        <td>as+w</td><td>as+w</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>as+w</td><td>as+w</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    
<p>These puppies will all be Black and Tan puppies, but will carry the gene to produce 
    white puppies. If you were to breed one of these puppies to a dog that has two white 
    parents and can only contribute that masking gene, then you have a chance of getting 
    solid white puppies as well as Black and Tan.</p>

<p id="p9"><img src=Sable.png alt="Sable" style="float: inline-end;" height="200px" width="200px">
    When you look at the order of dominance for German Shepherds, you notice that Sable, 
    Black and Tan and Bi Color are all dominant. What would happen if you were to breed a 
    Sable to a Bi Color or Black and Tan? While most of those puppies 
    would be sable, you may also get what is known as a “Patterned Sable.” Patterned sables are very 
    recognizable because they have what is known as the “classic” saddleback or blanket 
    back pattern, but replacing the black is sable. These dogs are capable of producing, 
    not just sables, but black and tan or bi color as well. The picture to the left is a 
    great example of a patterned sable. She has produced both sable and black and tan 
    puppies.</p>    

<p id="p10"><img src="Panda.png" alt="Panda" style="float: left;" height="200px"> Recently, 
    there has been some controversy regarding Panda Shepherds. These are German Shepherds 
    that have a lot of white covering their fronts with a traditional Black and 
    Tan pattern. Some people feel that the collie or some other breed that has patterns 
    like this were introduced into the line. This anomaly was first seen in only one line 
    of German Shepherds and only one puppy was born in a litter of otherwise “normal” black 
    and tan puppies with homozygous black and tan genes.

<p id="p11">Frankie, the GSD born with the panda pattern’s, DNA was sent for testing. The breeder 
    wanted to make sure that no other dog had somehow gotten into her kennels and bred with 
    her bitch. The genetic testing proved that Frankie was, indeed, a purebred German Shepherd. 
    The gene responsible for her unique coloring came from her father. She was the one and only 
    panda produced from this dog. All Panda Shepherds can trace their ancestry back to her.</p>

<p id="p12">Is the Panda gene dominant or recessive? It is a quite unique gene. If the puppy inherits 
     the panda gene from one parent, it will show. Panda Shepherds can be carriers of other 
    colors. The panda above has a panda sire and a blue and tan dam. He was born in a litter 
    of panda, black and tan and one white. Because of this he carries blue, black and tan, 
    white and panda. Because he carries the Panda gene, however, his phenotype (presenting 
    color) is Panda. Very recently, there have been German Shepherds that show the piebald 
    gene. This is a recessive white spotting gene. This gene can cause either a small patch 
    of white, or a mostly white dog. These dogs seem to have a type of masking gene similar 
    to the solid white GSD, but that doesn’t cover the entire dog. Puppies born with this gene 
    can, genetically, be any color with the white covering it.</p>

<p id="p13"><img src="Liver.png" alt="Liver" style="float: right;" height="200px">The AKC accepts 
    all colors for registration, Canine Good Citizen and Agility competitions, 
    but not for confirmation. That is not saying that you cannot show your liver, blue, white 
    or Panda. Blue, liver and pale, washed out coats are serious faults according to the breed 
    standard. White dogs are disqualified. Why is that? The AKC breed standard for the German 
    Shepherd Dogs counts blue, white, liver, panda and any dog with any piebalding as against 
    the breed standard. These colors will show up in “regular” colored dogs, but many breeders 
    will sell them with limited registration and spay/neuter contracts or even go so far as to 
    cull any off colored puppies so as not to tarnish their breeding reputation.
    This doesn’t mean that these Shepherds are any less than their normal colored 
    counterparts. If the breeder is a respectable breeder, they will be breeding based on 
    the breed standard regardless of what colors they breed.</p>
