<h3>About Us</h3>
<br>
<p>Justin and Josh have alwaysloved animals. Justin and his father bonded over the care of their rabbits and </p><img src="jj.jpg" width="200px" style="float: inline-end;"> 
German Shepherds. Justin received his first pair of rabbits when he was 6. A pair of red eyed white meat rabbits.
From the first litter he was hooked. Not long after, he also received his first German Shepherd Dog. Shenzi was a
black and tan, AKC registered terror. He was terrified of her for the first few months. German Shepherds are persistant
though, and he soon fell in love with her,, and later her daughter, Kya.
<p>Josh grew up with cats and Rottweilers. When he met Justin, Justin had 3 dogs and a ball python. Josh quickly fell in
    love with all sorts of animals. Mostly because Justin would bring them home and ask forgiveness later. No matter what 
    Justin has brought home, though, Josh has been a great sport.
<p>Justin and Josh got married on September 19, 2015. They recently bouught their first house and are looking forward to
    expanding their family with both 2 and 4 legged kids. They would like to thank you for visiting their site and welcome 
    messages.</p>  
<p>Justin is a huge nerd and loves anything to do with animals and genetics. Josh is a web development major at WGU and
    loves to spend his time cooking and going down internet rabbit holes. They both love music and being at home.</p>
